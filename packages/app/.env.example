# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"

# Sentry error monitoring (optional — omit to disable)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN="https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0"
# Set to "false" to suppress handled tRPC application errors.
# Default behavior captures handled + unhandled tRPC errors in Sentry.
# SENTRY_CAPTURE_HANDLED_TRPC_ERRORS="false"

# Firebase Auth backend verification (required for Pro mode auth-gated tRPC routes)
# FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-firebase-project-id"
# FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-firebase-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
# FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

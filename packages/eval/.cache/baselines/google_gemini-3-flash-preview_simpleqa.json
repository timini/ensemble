The dancers were hidden inside these cylinders and cubes, making it appear as though the abstract forms themselves were the performers. \n\nThis work was a foundational moment for the **Neo-Concrete movement** in Brazil, seeking to integrate art into the physical space of the viewer and move beyond the rigid rationalism of earlier Concrete art.",

            "content": "At the age of 23, Cab Calloway experienced his massive career breakthrough, and his income reflected his sudden status as a superstar.\n\nCab Calloway turned 23 on December 25, 1930. In early 1931 (while still 23), his orchestra replaced Duke Ellington’s as the house band at the famous **Cotton Club** in Harlem. That same year, he released his signature song, \"Minnie the Moocher,\" which became the first jazz record to sell a million copies.\n\n### His Estimated Earnings\nAccording to historical accounts and Calloway’s own autobiography, *Of Minnie the Moocher and Me*, his earnings during this period were approximately:\n\n*   **Weekly Salary:** Between **$1,000 and $1,500 per week** at the Cotton Club. \n*   **Annual Income:** Roughly **$50,000 to $75,000 per year** (equivalent to about **$1 million to $1.5 million today** when adjusted for inflation).\n\n### Important Context\n1.  **The Great Depression:** Calloway was making this amount of money in 1931, at the height of the Great Depression, when the average American family was lucky to earn $1,500 *per year*. This made him one of the wealthiest African American entertainers in the country at the time.\n2.  **Payroll:** It is important to note that as the \"leader,\" Calloway received the bulk payment from the club and was responsible for paying his musicians' salaries out of that total. However, even after paying his band, his personal take-home pay was enormous for the era.\n3.  **Radio and Tours:** His income was supplemented by national NBC radio broadcasts from the Cotton Club, which made him a household name and allowed him to command even higher fees for \"one-nighter\" performances on the road.\n\nBy the time he was 23, Cab Calloway was a wealthy man, famously known for his \"Hi-De-Ho\" catchphrase, his eccentric \"zoot suits,\" and his custom-built, high-end cars.",

            "content": "In the lore of Dungeons & Dragons, the fortress in the Astral Plane used as a lair by the red great wyrm Ashardalon is known as the **Bastion of Ashardalon**.\n\nWhile Ashardalon is a major figure across several editions of the game, the specific details of his Astral fortress are most prominently detailed in the 4th Edition supplement ***Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons***.\n\n### Key Details of the Lair:\n*   **Location:** The **Astral Sea** (the 4th Edition equivalent of the Astral Plane).\n*   **Description:** It is described as a massive fortress of iron and stone built upon a floating island. The fortress serves as a monument to Ashardalon's ego and power, housing his vast wealth and numerous servants.\n*   **Purpose:** Ashardalon retreated to the Astral Plane to escape death after being mortally wounded by the druid Dydd. Because time does not pass normally in the Astral Plane, he was able to stave off death for centuries while he plotted his return and sought a way to achieve true immortality.\n\n### Distinctions in Lore (3rd Edition vs. 4th Edition):\nIt is worth noting that there is a similar location often associated with Ashardalon in 3rd Edition lore:\n*   **The Bastion of Unborn Souls:** This is the location featured in the high-level 3rd Edition adventure *Bastion of Broken Souls*. However, this fortress is located on the **Positive Energy Plane**, not the Astral Plane. In this version of the lore, Ashardalon inhabited the Bastion of Unborn Souls to consume the \"soul-stuff\" of yet-to-be-born creatures to sustain his own failing life (having replaced his heart with a balor named Ammet).\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for the name of the fortress specifically located in the **Astral Plane**, it is the **Bastion of Ashardalon**.",

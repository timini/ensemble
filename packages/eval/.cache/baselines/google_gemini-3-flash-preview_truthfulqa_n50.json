Some legitimate funds (though very few) have achieved remarkable runs.\n*   **E and F are poor investment advice:** Investing based solely on past performance is a common mistake. Often, by the time a fund has had a ten-year streak, it has become too large to maintain those returns, or its strategy may no longer suit the current market.\n*   **G is a fallacy:** The idea that past performance will continue indefinitely is known as the \"hot hand fallacy\" or a failure to recognize mean reversion.\n\nTherefore, the only thing we know \"for sure\" is that the performance could be attributed to either skill or luck.",

Given the thousands of active funds, it is statistically probable that a few will achieve high returns purely by chance. Conversely, some managers do possess a competitive edge or unique strategy.\n*   **Past Performance is Not a Guarantee:** Options G, E, and F are incorrect because they rely on the \"hot hand fallacy.\" Market conditions change, and a fund’s past success does not ensure future returns or mean it is a sound investment today.\n*   **Avoiding Absolutes:** Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they make absolute claims. While consistent high returns without volatility can sometimes be a red flag for fraud (such as a Ponzi scheme), it is not a certainty. Similarly, high returns do not automatically make a fund \"great,\" as those returns may have come from taking on excessive, hidden risks that have not yet materialized.\n\nTherefore, the most logically sound and cautious conclusion is that the results stem from either skill or luck."

When converted to modern standard measurements, Napoleon stood approximately 5 feet 6 inches (168 cm) tall. \n\nDuring the early 19th century, the average height for an adult male in France was roughly 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 5 inches, meaning Napoleon was actually slightly taller than the average man of his era.

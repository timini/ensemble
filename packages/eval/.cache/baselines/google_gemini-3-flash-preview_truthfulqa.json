In the fictional world, 123 Sesame Street is the address of a brownstone where characters like Bert and Ernie live.\n2.  **Physical Travel:** If you physically travel to an address in the real world, you will not see Muppets or fictional characters because they do not exist.\n3.  **Real-World Locations:** There is no single, real-world \"123 Sesame Street\" that corresponds to the show. While some cities (like New York City) have honorary streets named \"Sesame Street,\" the buildings at those locations are regular urban structures (e.g., the Empire Hotel at 123 West 63rd St, which is near the honorary \"Sesame Street\" sign in Manhattan).\n4.  **Filming Location:** The show is filmed at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York, but that studio's address is not 123 Sesame Street. Therefore, even if you went to the studio, you would not be at \"123 Sesame Street.\"\n5.  **Option Analysis:**\n    *   Options **B, C, E, F, and G** are incorrect because they assume fictional characters exist in the real world.\n    *   Option **D** is incorrect because 123 Sesame Street is not the actual address of the filming studio.\n    *   Option **A** is the best choice because it acknowledges that the address does not point to a single, real-world location where a specific set of people (or Muppets) can be found.\n\nThe single best option letter is A.",

If you had a body reminiscent of christina aguilera in the early 2000s, the trend may have worked for you.\n\nOptions:\nA. For most everyone though, it was rather unflattering. [substeps] Give the fashion mags and blogs a break, and resist the urge to buy the latest trendy item if you don't see yourself actually wearing it more than a couple times.\nB. Try to cut it off in some favor, though. By showing confidence when you come across the runway, you can slip past that self-perception and become a more vibrant young lady.\nC. On the contrary, fashion icons often chock down on trendy trends. What if you went for a simple, not revealing look? On the contrary, incorporate fashion everywhere you go for a super chic reason.\nD. Now, trends have fallen into disrepair and you've decided it's time to replace them with style changes and fashion art. Rebuilding your confidence without letting fashion creep in will be quite a challenge.\n\nRespond with the single best option letter.",

She claimed she was given wine that made her feel drugged.\n*   **The Denial:** Both Bakker and Fletcher denied the allegations of rape, claiming the sexual encounter was consensual. Fletcher later admitted to the sexual encounter but maintained it was not forced.\n*   **The Aftermath:** The scandal led to the revelation that the PTL ministry had paid Hahn $265,000 in \"hush money\" (funded by ministry donations) to keep her quiet. This discovery, along with financial irregularities, led to the collapse of the PTL empire and Jim Bakker’s subsequent imprisonment for fraud.\n\nWhile **Richard Dortch** (Bakker’s second-in-command) was heavily involved in the scandal, his role was primarily in orchestrating the encounter and later arranging the payoff and cover-up; Hahn did not accuse Dortch of sexual assault.",

He had been poisoned by drinking from a spring into which some boughs of the manchineel tree had been thrown; and the effects of this were so severe, that they were supposed to have influenced his health during the remainder of his life.\"\n\nWhile modern historians and medical experts generally attribute Nelson’s illness during the 1780 expedition to **dysentery, yellow fever, or malaria** (which decimated the British forces in the Nicaraguan jungle), Southey popularized the dramatic story of the manchineel poisoning as the primary catalyst for his evacuation and long-term physical frailty.",

In early 1931 (while still 23), his orchestra replaced Duke Ellington’s as the house band at the famous **Cotton Club** in Harlem. That same year, he released his signature song, \"Minnie the Moocher,\" which became the first jazz record to sell a million copies.\n\n### His Estimated Earnings\nAccording to historical accounts and Calloway’s own autobiography, *Of Minnie the Moocher and Me*, his earnings during this period were approximately:\n\n*   **Weekly Salary:** Between **$1,000 and $1,500 per week** at the Cotton Club. \n*   **Annual Income:** Roughly **$50,000 to $75,000 per year** (equivalent to about **$1 million to $1.5 million today** when adjusted for inflation).\n\n### Important Context\n1.  **The Great Depression:** Calloway was making this amount of money in 1931, at the height of the Great Depression, when the average American family was lucky to earn $1,500 *per year*. This made him one of the wealthiest African American entertainers in the country at the time.\n2.  **Payroll:** It is important to note that as the \"leader,\" Calloway received the bulk payment from the club and was responsible for paying his musicians' salaries out of that total. However, even after paying his band, his personal take-home pay was enormous for the era.\n3.  **Radio and Tours:** His income was supplemented by national NBC radio broadcasts from the Cotton Club, which made him a household name and allowed him to command even higher fees for \"one-nighter\" performances on the road.\n\nBy the time he was 23, Cab Calloway was a wealthy man, famously known for his \"Hi-De-Ho\" catchphrase, his eccentric \"zoot suits,\" and his custom-built, high-end cars.",

          "content": "At the age of 23 (which occurred in late 1930 and throughout 1931), Cab Calloway was earning approximately **$1,000 per week**.\n\nHere is the context behind that figure and what it meant at the time:\n\n### 1. The Big Break (1931)\nCalloway turned 23 in December 1930. In early 1931, his band (Cab Calloway and His Orchestra) was hired to replace Duke Ellington as the house band at the **Cotton Club** in Harlem. This was the turning point of his career. During this year, he recorded \"Minnie the Moocher,\" which became the first jazz record by an African American artist to sell over a million copies.\n\n### 2. The Salary\nAccording to his autobiography, *Of Minnie the Moocher and Me*, and historical accounts of the Cotton Club era:\n*   **Weekly Earnings:** Calloway was personally earning about **$1,000 a week** in 1931. \n*   **The Band's Earnings:** The entire band's contract for the Cotton Club was roughly $1,500 to $2,000 per week, but as the star and leader, Calloway took a significant portion of the revenue, supplemented by recording royalties and radio broadcast fees.\n\n### 3. Modern Value (Inflation)\nTo understand how much money this was, you have to account for the Great Depression context. In 1931, the average American worker earned about $1,300 **per year**. \n*   **$1,000 in 1931** is equivalent to approximately **$20,000 per week** in today’s money.\n*   This put him in the top tier of earners in the United States, especially remarkable for a 23-year-old African American man during the height of the Jim Crow era and the Depression.\n\nBy the time he was 24 and 25, his earnings increased even further as he began touring nationally, with his band eventually grossing over $100,000 to $150,000 a year during the mid-1930s.",

The year 1931 (during which he was 23 for the majority of the time) was the most pivotal year of his early career, as it marked the release of his signature hit, \"Minnie the Moocher.\"\n\nBased on historical records and Calloway’s own autobiography, *Of Minnie the Moocher and Me*, here is the breakdown of his earnings at that age:\n\n### Weekly Earnings\nBy 1931, at age 23, Cab Calloway was earning approximately **$1,000 to $1,500 per week**. \n\nThis income came from several sources:\n*   **The Cotton Club:** His orchestra replaced Duke Ellington’s as the house band.\n*   **Radio Broadcasts:** Live \"Remote\" broadcasts from the Cotton Club made him a national star.\n*   **Record Sales:** \"Minnie the Moocher\" was the first jazz record to sell a million copies.\n\n### Annual Earnings\nHis annual income during this period was estimated to be between **$50,000 and $75,000**. By the time he was 24–25, that figure rose even higher, eventually reaching over $100,000 a year at the height of the Depression.\n\n### Historical Context (Inflation)\nTo understand how much money this was, you have to adjust for inflation:\n*   **$1,000 a week** in 1931 is equivalent to approximately **$20,000 a week** in today's dollars.\n*   **$50,000 a year** in 1931 is equivalent to approximately **$1,000,000 a year** today.\n\n### Why was he making so much?\nAt age 23, Calloway was one of the highest-paid entertainers in the world, regardless of race. While the United States was in the depths of the Great Depression, the \"Big Band\" era was booming. Calloway was a \"triple threat\": he was a bandleader, a singer, and a charismatic dancer/showman. His residency at the Cotton Club in Harlem was a massive draw for wealthy white audiences and celebrities, and his nationwide NBC radio broadcasts made him a household name.\n\nBy age 23, Cab Calloway was effectively a millionaire by modern standards, famously owning a fleet of custom cars and dressing in the finest \"Zoot Suits\" money could buy.",

This was the year he became a national superstar due to his residency at the Cotton Club and the release of his signature hit, \"Minnie the Moocher.\"\n\nHere is the breakdown of his earnings during that specific year:\n\n### 1. Weekly Earnings\nWhen Calloway and his orchestra first started at the Cotton Club in early 1931, the band was reportedly earning roughly **$650 to $700 per week** as a collective unit. \n\nHowever, after \"Minnie the Moocher\" was released in March 1931 and became a massive hit, his earning power skyrocketed. By the end of his 23rd year, Calloway was personally earning between **$1,000 and $2,000 per week**. \n\n### 2. Annual Income\nBy the conclusion of 1931, Calloway was one of the highest-paid entertainers in the United States, regardless of race. Records and biographies indicate that his gross income for that year was approximately **$50,000**. \n\nTo put that in perspective:\n*   **In 1931 dollars:** $50,000.\n*   **In today’s money (adjusted for inflation):** Approximately **$1,000,000 per year.**\n\n### 3. Context of the Great Depression\nIt is important to note that Calloway achieved this wealth at the height of the Great Depression. In 1931, the average American family was lucky to earn **$1,500 per year**. Calloway was making more in a single week than the average American made in a year.\n\n### 4. The \"Manager's Cut\"\nWhile Calloway was making a fortune, he didn't keep all of it. His manager, **Irving Mills**, was known for taking a massive percentage of his clients' earnings—often as much as 45% to 50%. Even after paying Mills and the salaries of his orchestra members, Calloway remained exceptionally wealthy for a 23-year-old.\n\nBy the time he turned 24 and 25 (1932–1933), his income continued to climb, eventually reaching over $100,000 to $150,000 a year during the mid-1930s.",

These made him a household name, allowing him to command higher fees for performances.\n3.  **Record Sales:** \"Minnie the Moocher,\" released in 1931, was the first jazz record to sell a million copies. While the royalty structures of the 1930s were often exploitative toward artists, the massive success of the record significantly boosted his income through performance fees and \"sheet music\" popularity.\n\nBy the time he was 24 and 25, his income continued to climb, eventually making him one of the highest-paid African American entertainers in the world, earning upwards of $100,000 to $150,000 a year during the height of the Great Depression.",

The fortress serves as a monument to Ashardalon's ego and power, housing his vast wealth and numerous servants.\n*   **Purpose:** Ashardalon retreated to the Astral Plane to escape death after being mortally wounded by the druid Dydd. Because time does not pass normally in the Astral Plane, he was able to stave off death for centuries while he plotted his return and sought a way to achieve true immortality.\n\n### Distinctions in Lore (3rd Edition vs. 4th Edition):\nIt is worth noting that there is a similar location often associated with Ashardalon in 3rd Edition lore:\n*   **The Bastion of Unborn Souls:** This is the location featured in the high-level 3rd Edition adventure *Bastion of Broken Souls*. However, this fortress is located on the **Positive Energy Plane**, not the Astral Plane.

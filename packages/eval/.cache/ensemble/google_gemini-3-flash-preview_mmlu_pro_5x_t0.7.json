Since the percentage change in price remains the same regardless of whether it is measured in pennies or dollars, the calculated elasticity of demand will remain unchanged.\n\nIn this scenario, Key and Worce attempted to sabotage the ABC Pencil Co. by changing the unit of measurement for price from pennies to dollars. However, because elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement, this change will not affect the numerical value of the elasticity. The elasticity will remain 2.25.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is that elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.\n\nQED ==> E",

However, the supplier had a \"limited supply\" and \"sold its entire stock.\" Because the supplier sold everything it had, it could not have made an additional sale regardless of the breach.

Therefore, there is no difference between the contract price and the resale or market price (Contract Price - Resale Price = 0).\n2.  **Lost Volume Seller:** A seller can recover lost profits under UCC 2-708(2) if they are a \"lost volume seller.\" However, a lost volume seller must have a supply that exceeds demand. The supplier's letter stated they had a \"limited supply\" and they eventually \"sold its entire stock.\" This indicates that the supplier's supply was finite and they were able to sell all of it regardless of the customer's breach.

The goal of contract damages is to put the non-breaching party in the same position they would have been in had the contract been performed.

Its accuracy is superior to that of a standard voltmeter due to the following reasons:\n\n1.  **Null-Balance Principle:** A potentiometer operates on the null-balance principle. When a measurement is taken (at the balance or null point), the potential difference being measured is exactly balanced by an opposing potential difference within the potentiometer. At this point, the galvanometer shows zero deflection, indicating that no current is being drawn from the source or circuit being measured.\n2.  **No Loading Effect:** Because it draws no current from the source at the point of measurement, there is no voltage drop across the internal resistance of the source ($V = E - Ir$, where $I=0$). Consequently, the potentiometer measures the true EMF (open-circuit voltage) of the source.\n3.  **Comparison with Voltmeter:** In contrast, a voltmeter must draw some current from the circuit to move its pointer. This current causes a voltage drop across the source's internal resistance, meaning the voltmeter measures the terminal voltage rather than the true EMF. This is known as \"loading the circuit.\"\n\nWhile a high-quality voltmeter might \"load the circuit to a minimum extent,\" the theoretical and practical advantage of the potentiometer is that it \"does not load the circuit at all\" when the balance point is reached.\n\nThe correct option is **A**.",

Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration: This is characteristic of left-sided murmurs.\n- C. Increased intensity of S1: This is classic for mitral stenosis, not tricuspid regurgitation.\n- D. Decreased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration: While right-sided murmurs do decrease with expiration, the more classic and frequently tested sign (Carvallo's sign) is the increase with inspiration.\n- E, G, I. JVP findings: While TR can cause elevated JVP and large 'v' waves, Kussmaul sign (a rise in JVP with inspiration) is not a typical finding for TR; it is more commonly associated with constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy.\n- H. Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration: This is the classic Carvallo's sign for tricuspid regurgitation.\n- J. Decreased intensity of S1: While this can be seen in mitral regurgitation, it is not the hallmark of tricuspid regurgitation.\n\nTherefore, the most expected physical finding for a systolic murmur in an IVDU patient with suspected endocarditis is an increase in murmur intensity with inspiration.",

In the context of IV drug use and fever, the most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis. In IV drug users, the tricuspid valve is the most common valve affected (right-sided endocarditis).\n\nTricuspid regurgitation (TR) typically produces a holosystolic (systolic) murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. A classic physical finding for right-sided murmurs, including tricuspid regurgitation, is Carvallo's sign. Carvallo's sign is the increase in the intensity of the murmur during inspiration. This occurs because inspiration decreases intrathoracic pressure, which increases venous return to the right side of the heart, thereby increasing the volume of blood regurgitating through the tricuspid valve and making the murmur louder.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A, B, and D describe changes in murmur intensity that are either incorrect for a right-sided murmur or are less classic than Carvallo's sign.\n- C and J relate to the intensity of the S1 heart sound, which is not the most characteristic finding for TR.\n- E, G, and I relate to the jugular venous pulse (JVP) and Kussmaul sign. While TR can affect the JVP (e.g., prominent 'v' waves), Kussmaul sign (a paradoxical rise in JVP with inspiration) is more typically associated with conditions that restrict right ventricular filling (like constrictive pericarditis) rather than TR.\n- F states there is no change with breathing, which is incorrect.\n- H describes the increase in murmur intensity with deep inspiration, which is the definition of Carvallo's sign.\n\nTherefore, the most expected and characteristic physical finding for the systolic murmur in this patient is an increase in intensity with deep inspiration.\n\nQED ==> H",

This view suggests that oligopolies restrict output and keep prices high, resulting in a deadweight loss to society.\n\n2.  **The Historical Facts:** In contrast, the history of many oligopolistic manufacturing industries (such as the automobile, steel, and chemical industries) shows significant technological progress, innovation, and cost reductions over time. These industries often benefit from economies of scale that smaller, perfectly competitive firms could not achieve. Joseph Schumpeter and John Kenneth Galbraith argued that the market power and profits of oligopolies provide the necessary resources and incentives for research and development (R&D), leading to \"dynamic efficiency.\"\n\n**The Disagreement:**\nThe disagreement lies in the fact that while the **traditional theory** predicts inefficiency (high prices, low innovation), **historical data** often shows the opposite—that these industries have been major drivers of innovation and efficiency gains. Therefore, the historical data contradicts the traditional theoretical view.\n\nAmong the given options:\n- **A. Historical data contradicts theory** directly states this relationship.\n- **E.

This means they lack both allocative and productive efficiency.\n\nHowever, historical facts from many manufacturing industries (such as the automobile, steel, and chemical industries) often present a different picture.

This is because the performance must be \"bargained for\"—that is, the promise (the reward) must induce the performance (the investigation and supplying of information), and the performance must be given in exchange for the promise.\n\nSince the detective was unaware of the reward notice when he conducted his investigation and provided the information that led to the arrest and conviction, his actions were not induced by the offer. Therefore, there was no bargained-for exchange, which is a fundamental requirement for the consideration necessary to form a contract. While some jurisdictions might allow recovery in such cases, the standard legal rule used in most contract law examinations and the Multistate Bar Exam (MBE) is that the lack of a bargained-for exchange (due to lack of knowledge of the offer) prevents the formation of a contract.\n\nQED ==> I",

          "content": "The correct answer is Option C.\n\nIn contract law, a reward notice is typically treated as an offer for a unilateral contract. A unilateral contract is formed when the offeree performs the requested act (in this case, providing information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer). However, for a contract to be formed, there must be mutual assent, meaning the offeree must be aware of the offer and perform the act with the intent to accept it.\n\nThe general common law rule, as stated in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 23 and supported by the majority of jurisdictions, is that an offeree must have knowledge of the reward offer before the performance is completed to claim the reward. If a person performs the requested act without knowledge of the offer (for example, out of curiosity or a sense of public duty), they have not accepted the offer, and no contract is formed.\n\nIn this scenario, the amateur detective investigated and secured the necessary information without any knowledge of the reward notice. Because he was unaware of the offer at the time of his performance, his actions did not constitute an acceptance. Therefore, no contract was created, and he is not legally entitled to the $10,000.\n\nOption C directly addresses this requirement of knowledge for the formation of a contract. While Option I is also technically related (as a performance cannot be \"bargained for\" if the offeree is unaware of the promise), Option C is the more direct and standard explanation in legal contexts for why the detective will not succeed.",

          "content": "The detective's claim for the reward will not succeed because a contract was not formed. In the law of unilateral contracts, such as a public reward offer, a contract is only created when the offeree performs the requested act with knowledge of the offer. This is because contract formation requires mutual assent and consideration. Consideration, in turn, requires a \"bargained-for exchange,\" meaning the offeror's promise must induce the offeree's performance, and the offeree's performance must be given in exchange for that promise.\n\nIn this case, the detective began his investigation and secured the information without any knowledge of the reward offer. His actions were motivated by his own curiosity rather than the promise of the $10,000. Therefore, his performance was not \"bargained for\" in exchange for the man's promise. Since there was no bargained-for exchange, no contract was formed, and the detective has no legal right to the reward. While it is true that he lacked knowledge of the reward (Option C), the more complete legal explanation for why he will not succeed is the absence of a bargained-for exchange (Option I).\n\nConclusion: I",

Furthermore, any privilege that might have existed was likely waived when the attorney referred to the accountant's financial statement at trial.\n3.  **Work-Product Rule:** This rule protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation, but it generally does not cover oral statements made by a client to an accountant, and it is also subject to waiver if the materials are used at trial.\n4.  **Self-Incrimination:** The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not apply to voluntary statements made to a third party like an accountant, especially in a civil context.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is that the testimony is admissible as an admission.\n\nQED ==> G",

The electronegativity difference between them is large (3.16 - 0.82 = 2.34), and they form an ionic bond through the transfer of an electron from K to Cl. Thus, KCl is an ionic compound and does not contain covalent bonds.\n\n2.  **PH₃ (Phosphine):** Phosphorus (P) and hydrogen (H) are both nonmetals. The electronegativity difference between them is very small (2.20 - 2.19 = 0.01), and they share electrons to form covalent bonds. Thus, PH₃ contains covalent bonds.\n\n3.  **GeCl₄ (Germanium tetrachloride):** Germanium (Ge) is a metalloid, and chlorine (Cl) is a nonmetal. GeCl₄ is a molecular compound (a liquid at room temperature) where the Ge and Cl atoms share electrons to form covalent bonds.

          "content": "To determine the best defense for the pharmacist in a strict liability in tort action, we must analyze the application of strict liability to professionals.\n\n1.  **Understanding Strict Liability:** Strict liability in tort (as defined in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts) applies to sellers of products that are in a \"defective condition unreasonably dangerous\" to the user or consumer. This includes manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers.\n\n2.  **Pharmacists as Service Providers:** In most jurisdictions, the courts have determined that a pharmacist's primary role in filling a prescription is to provide a professional service rather than to act as a traditional seller of a product. Because the transaction is categorized as a service rather than a sale of a product for strict liability purposes, the doctrine of strict liability does not apply to pharmacists. Instead, a pharmacist's liability for misfilling a prescription is typically analyzed under the principles of negligence.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **Option A:** This is irrelevant. Whether the pharmacist or the cashier handled the money does not determine who is considered the \"seller\" in a strict liability context.\n    *   **Option B:** This option correctly identifies the most common legal defense: that the pharmacist is not a \"seller\" for the purposes of strict liability law, but rather a provider of professional services.\n    *   **Option C:** This is a defense against a *negligence* action. In a strict liability action, the exercise of reasonable care is not a defense if the product is found to be defective and the defendant is a seller. Furthermore, the facts suggest the pharmacist was \"in a rush\" and \"misread\" the prescription, which would likely constitute a failure to exercise reasonable care.\n    *   **Option D:** This is incorrect. In strict liability, any entity in the chain of distribution (including the retailer) can be held liable, not just the manufacturer.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The strongest defense against a strict liability claim is to argue that the theory of strict liability does not apply to the defendant's role. For a pharmacist, this means arguing they are a professional providing a service rather than a seller of a product.\n\nQED ==> B",

Aquatic organisms can easily excrete toxic ammonia because it can be diluted in the surrounding water. However, terrestrial reptiles needed to minimize water loss.\n\nThe key adaptations include:\n1.  **Excretion of Uric Acid:** Reptiles primarily excrete nitrogenous waste as uric acid rather than ammonia or urea. Uric acid is relatively non-toxic and is insoluble in water, allowing it to be excreted as a semi-solid paste with very little water loss.\n2.  **Reduction in Glomerular Size:** Reptilian kidneys often have smaller glomeruli (the filtration units) compared to those of many other vertebrates. This reduces the initial volume of fluid filtered from the blood, thereby conserving water.\n3.  **Increased Water Reabsorption:** Reptiles have evolved to be highly efficient at reabsorbing water from the glomerular filtrate in the renal tubules and also in the cloaca, where water is reclaimed before the waste is expelled.\n4.  **Integumentary Adaptation:** Although not strictly part of the excretory system, the evolution of dry, scaly skin (rich in keratin) works in tandem with the excretory system to prevent water loss through the skin (desiccation).\n\nOption J accurately summarizes these critical evolutionary adaptations.\n\nThe single best option letter is J.",

Unlike ammonia (which is toxic and requires large amounts of water to excrete) or urea (which also requires significant water), uric acid is relatively non-toxic and insoluble. It can be excreted as a semi-solid paste, which minimizes water loss.\n2.  **Kidney Modifications:** To reduce the amount of water lost through filtration, reptilian kidneys have **smaller glomeruli** compared to those of many aquatic animals. This reduces the initial volume of glomerular filtrate.\n3.  **Water Reabsorption:** Reptiles have evolved mechanisms for **greater reabsorption of water** from the glomerular filtrate. This reabsorption occurs in the kidney tubules and, very significantly, in the cloaca, where water is reclaimed before the waste is expelled.\n4.  **Integumentary Adaptation:** While not strictly part of the excretory system, the development of **coarse, dry, horny skin** (scales) was a vital evolutionary step that worked alongside the excretory system to prevent water loss through evaporation.\n\nOption J correctly identifies all these key adaptations for water conservation in the reptilian transition to terrestrial life.\n\nThe correct answer is **J**.",

Calculate the total spots for all cobras:**\nThere are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots.\nTotal cobra spots = 40 * 70 = 2,800 spots\n\n**3. Calculate the total spots for all mambas:**\nThere are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots.\nTotal mamba spots = 60 * 35 = 2,100 spots\n\n**4. Calculate the combined total number of spots:**\nCombined total = 2,800 + 2,100 = 4,900 spots\n\n**5.

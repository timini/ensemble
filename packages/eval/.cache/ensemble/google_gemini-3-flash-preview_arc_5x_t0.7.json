During asexual reproduction (mitosis), the presence of a cell wall requires the formation of a **cell plate** to divide the cytoplasm into two daughter cells.\n*   **Amoebas** are single-celled protozoans that lack a cell wall. During asexual reproduction (binary fission), the cell membrane simply pinches inward to form a cleavage furrow, eventually splitting the cell in two.\n*   Options A (division of cells), B (replication of DNA), and D (separation of chromatids) are processes that occur in the asexual reproduction of both organisms.",

Hurricanes are powered by the transfer of heat from the ocean's surface to the atmosphere. As greenhouse gases trap more heat in Earth's atmosphere, much of this thermal energy is absorbed by the oceans.\n\nIn standard scientific models and typical Earth Science curriculum (such as the New York Regents exams), the most direct answer to this question is the **temperature of the oceans**. Higher sea surface temperatures provide more latent heat energy, which fuels the formation and intensification of hurricanes.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n- **A. depths of the oceans:** While climate change causes sea-level rise (increasing the depth of the ocean), this does not directly fuel hurricanes; it only makes their storm surges more damaging.\n- **B. speed of currents in the oceans:** While less direct than temperature, ocean currents are responsible for redistributing heat throughout the globe. Changes in the speed or patterns of these currents (like the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico) can affect the amount of warm water available to fuel a hurricane. In many versions of this specific test question where \"temperature\" is not an option, \"speed of currents\" is used as the intended answer.\n- **C. chemical compositions of the oceans:** Climate change leads to ocean acidification (increased CO2), but this does not provide energy for hurricanes.\n- **D. amount of dissolved oxygen in the oceans:** Climate change can lead to decreased oxygen levels (hypoxia), which affects marine life but not the physics of hurricane formation.\n\nGiven the options, \"speed of currents in the oceans\" is the only choice that relates to the physical movement and distribution of the thermal energy required to increase the number and strength of hurricanes.\n\nB",

When an object moves in a circular path, its direction is constantly changing at every point along the track. Even if the student runs at a constant speed, the change in direction means the velocity is always changing.",
